# Polkadot Legal Bounty — Payments & Reporting Repository

## Purpose

This repository provides a **public, auditable record** of payments, reports, and supporting documentation related to the **Polkadot Legal Bounty**.

Its purpose is to:

* document how bounty funds are allocated and paid,
* link approved work to invoices and on-chain child bounty payouts,
* provide a single reference point for curators, auditors, and the community.

This repository covers **financial and operational transparency only**. Legal advice, client-specific material, and attorney-client privileged communications are intentionally excluded.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Payment Tracking

All bounty-related payments are indexed in a single tracking table:

**Payment Tracking Spreadsheet**
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZJBqBbREKOGXE5v-g85fAN9nxzprXFqblXP7ia8vyBM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZJBqBbREKOGXE5v-g85fAN9nxzprXFqblXP7ia8vyBM/edit?usp=sharing)

The table links:

* Child Bounty IDs
* Recipients
* USD amounts and DOT conversions
* DOT/USD reference prices
* Call data and call hashes
* Invoice references
* On-chain child bounty links

This spreadsheet acts as the **primary index** for all payments referenced in this repository.

### 2. Invoices

All invoices issued by the legal service provider are stored in the **`/invoices`** directory.

Invoices provide:

* the billing basis for each payout,
* time and scope references,
* traceability between approved work and child bounty payments.

All reports and child bounty–related documentation are stored in the **`/reports`** directory.
